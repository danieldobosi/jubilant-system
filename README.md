what is this for?
  Currently the Autel Evo II Pro (RTK) UAS does not support terrain following for mapping missions.
  You can import a KML file generated by external 3rd party software like QgroundControl. 
  In this KML file, the height is dispayed in AMSL instead of AGL

The script reads the KML file and replaces the AMSL with AGL so it allows the UAS to do terrain following mapping missions

Beware:
  not tested
  after importing to Autel Explorer v2, the app adds 3 additional waypoints to the end of the mission with "0" height. Please remove these
  use it on your own risk
  
how to use:
  install python
  create a mission in QgroundControl
  export the kml file
  start the script with python scriptname.py mission.kml
  a new kml file will be created and it can be imported to Autel Explorer
